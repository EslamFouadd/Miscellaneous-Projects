# Build a Data Science Web App with Streamlit and Python

Now, you are going to get comfortable with using Python and Streamlit to build beautiful and interactive web apps with zero web development experience! We are going to load, explore, visualize and interact with data, and generate dashboards in less than 100 lines of Python code! We will accomplish it by completing each task in the project:

Task 1: Project Overview and Demo

Task 2: Turn Simple Python Scripts into Web Apps

Task 3: Load the Motor Vehicle Collisions Data

Task 4: Visualize Data on a Map

Task 5: Filtering Data and Interactive Tables

Task 6: Plot Filtered Data on a 3D Interactive Map

Task 7: 3D Interactive Map (continued)

Task 8: Charts and Histograms

Task 9: Select Data Using Dropdowns

While you are watching me work on each step, you will get a cloud desktop with all the required software pre-installed. This will allow you to follow along the instructions to complete the above mentioned tasks. After all, we learn best with active, hands-on learning.
